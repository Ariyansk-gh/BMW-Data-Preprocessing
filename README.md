# ðŸš— BMW Data Preprocessing & Visualization (2010â€“2024)

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project
This project focuses on **data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of BMWâ€™s sales data from **2010 to 2024**.  
The goal is to understand sales performance, identify trends, and visualize insights using Python.

It demonstrates how to handle raw datasets â€” cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing them to derive useful information for better business understanding.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- To explore BMW sales patterns from 2010â€“2024  
- To preprocess and clean the dataset by handling missing or inconsistent data  
- To visualize important sales insights through charts and graphs  
- To practice Python-based data analysis for a real-world dataset  

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation  
- **NumPy** â€“ numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ data visualization  
- **Seaborn** â€“ advanced statistical plots

##  Key Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading:**  
   Imported the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Renamed columns for better readability  
   - Converted data types where necessary  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed patterns in sales, model performance, and production year trends  
   - Identified outliers and distributions using boxplots and histograms  

4. **Data Visualization:**  
   Created multiple visual insights using:
   - Line plots  
   - Bar charts  
   - Histograms  
   - Count plots  
   - Pie charts  
   - Box plots  
   - Scatter plots  

5. **Conclusions:**  
   Summarized findings such as top-performing models, highest sales years, and fuel-type trends.

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights Discovered
- Sales peaked during specific years, showing BMWâ€™s strong market performance.  
- Certain models consistently outperformed others in sales.  
- Electric and hybrid variants showed a rising trend after 2020.  
- Visualization helped spot patterns that could support business decisions.
